[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbase_interfaces_demo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "base_interfaces_demo", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "base_interfaces_demo" with any of the following names:

    base_interfaces_demoConfig.cmake
    base_interfaces_demo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "base_interfaces_demo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "base_interfaces_demo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "base_interfaces_demo" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
